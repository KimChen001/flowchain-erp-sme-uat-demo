# Route Mutation Classification v1

Round 24 classifies API route behavior and adds a database-mode guard for un-migrated legacy JSON write routes.

## Classification Terms

- `read-only`: returns current read-model or demo state and should not write business records.
- `preview-only`: prepares reviewable draft output and must not create business records.
- `legacy-mutation`: existing manual/demo workflow write route that mutates JSON-backed demo data.
- `future-mutation`: reserved for a future draft-confirm write workflow.
- `diagnostics`: health, preflight, or operational status.
- `static`: frontend/static asset request.

## Database Mode v1 Rule

When `FLOWCHAIN_PERSISTENCE_MODE=database`:

- read-only routes remain available;
- preview-only routes remain available;
- default health remains available;
- legacy mutation routes are blocked before route handlers can call `writeDb`;
- blocked routes return:

```json
{ "error": "This mutation is not available in database persistence mode yet." }
```

The block response uses HTTP `501` and contains no stack trace, provider details, or database configuration.

Database mode uses migrated DB read adapters where available and JSON read fallback where not yet migrated. It does not write JSON in database mode.

## Implementation

New module:

- `server/domain/route-classification.mjs`

Exports:

- `ROUTE_CLASSES`
- `DATABASE_MODE_MUTATION_BLOCKED_ERROR`
- `listRouteClassifications()`
- `classifyRoute(method, pathname)`
- `isLegacyMutationRoute(method, pathname)`
- `isDatabaseModeWriteBlocked({ persistenceMode, method, pathname })`
- `databaseModeMutationBlockedPayload()`
- `sendDatabaseModeMutationBlocked(res, send)`

`server/routes/scm-legacy.routes.mjs` applies the guard after health handling and before legacy auth, forecast, and route dispatch write paths.

## JSON Compatibility

Default JSON mode is unchanged:

- legacy manual/demo mutations still work as before;
- read routes keep their response shapes;
- action draft preview remains preview-only;
- normal test/typecheck/build does not require `DATABASE_URL`.

## Non-Goals

This round does not:

- remove legacy routes;
- implement DB write workflows;
- add Prisma, Drizzle, or any ORM;
- add a database connection;
- create real PR/RFQ/PO/GRN/inventory postings through DB;
- add auth/RBAC;
- change default JSON behavior;
- mutate `data/scm-demo.json`.
