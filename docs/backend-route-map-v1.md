# Backend Route Map v1

## Route Classification

- Read: returns current workspace/read-model state without mutation.
- Preview: prepares reviewable draft data and does not mutate business records.
- Manual/legacy write: existing local workflow write route, not used by AI autonomous execution.

## Safety Notes

- Default persistence is local JSON workspace data.
- See [Route mutation classification](route-mutation-classification-v1.md) for the complete database-mode v1 guard. In explicit database mode, read-only and preview-only routes remain available while legacy mutation routes are blocked until migrated.
- External AI provider access is disabled by default.
- Action drafts are preview-only.
- No full finance/GL/payment/tax execution exists.
- Future database adapters should preserve these contracts before replacing JSON behavior.
